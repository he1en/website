Consider, for instance, Electronic Arts Sports’ recent decision to include women soccer players and teams in its blockbuster computer game FIFA 16. Today, soccer is among the most popular women’s sports across the globe, with more than 1.6 million registered female players in the US alone. By opening games to a new users, FIFA 16 and EA SPORTS™ has massively expanded its global customer base.',

    description: 'The gender gap in literacy remains a hidden barrier to women’s financial inclusion among undeserved groups in many developing countries. ATMs, for instance, require a basic ability to read and understand numbers and text, making them inaccessible to illiterate groups. By integrating gender analysis into the design process, tech-designers can become aware of such barriers and create better and more gender inclusive solutions. For example, providing simple icons and verbal instructions as alternatives to text and numbers in ATMs represents an innovative example in this regard.',

    description: 'Public transportation systems that conceptualized new data-collection techniques to capture the “mobility of care” (travel for child-care, elder-care, etc.) created more efficient systems. Governments and civil engineers collect data to understand how people use trains, subways, and bus systems. The gendered innovation in this case study is reconceptualizing how data are collected. Traditionally, governments collect data in eight trip categories: employment, education, shopping, leisure, and the like (see image left). People who travel solely for employment tend to travel directly from home to work and back again. \n None of these traditional trip categories captures caring work—caring for children, the elderly, or households. People who travel for employment plus caring work have different travel patterns. They tend to travel from home to daycare and on to work. Leaving work, they may stop at the food market, the dry cleaners, and daycare before returning home. Conceptualizing the "mobility of care" as a category of analysis creates more efficient transportation systems, reducing costs and enhancing the quality of life.',

    description: 'When it comes to commenting on news articles, female participation is disturbingly low. Studies show that male-authored comments far outnumber female comments (by 72% at The New York Times, for example). The gender bias of news commenting impacts both business and participation. Fewer comments by women jeopardizes the marketplace of ideas and opinion. Less involvement and time spent on a news site impacts the bottom line as women are less exposed to advertising. News comments surfaces gender differences that range from communication behavior to design considerations including responses to story and photo placement. It also challenges news organizations to provide opportunities for users to respond to stories and journalists in a way that is richer, more useful, more interesting, more inclusive to all.',

Gendered Innovations have led to efforts to develop algorithms that determine the gender of each person in a text—a deep “fix” that enhances the quality of translation. \n When trained on historical data (as Google Translate is), the system inherits bias (including gender bias). Importantly, Google translate is creating the future (technology, i.e., our devices, programs, and processes shape human attitudes, behaviors, and culture). See: ',

    description: 'Anyone who has spent time on Pinterest will not be surprised that the content tends to favor women. Indeed, The Wall Street Journal has reported that up until 2014, 71% of Pinterest’s users have been women. But more recently, the “visual discovery site” has received a 73% increase in male users. Pinterest has adapted to the change by updating its search algorithm to make the site more gender neutral. When a male user searches for watches, he now may see pins “inspired by what other guys have pinned” instead of women’s timepieces. Why the change? Much like many of the other social sites, Pinterest is looking to retain and build its male audience in order to sell more ads through its “promoted pins.”',
